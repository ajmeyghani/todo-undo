# Todo app

Basic todo app with undo/redo super powers (no gui). Even though classical oop might not be the best choice for building data oriented applications, it doesn't hurt to implement some old-school patterns in JavaScript. This app attempts to implement pattersn like the command pattern, prototype pattern, etc etc.

**Super Powers** include:

- undo and redo
- no gui

## Dev

`npm i -g nodemon`
`npm i && npm run tdd`

## Test

`npm t`
